# Lumina: Eternal Memories on the Blockchain

## The Problem

We all have precious memories we want to preserve forever - photos of loved ones, voice recordings, videos of special moments. But traditional storage is fragile: hard drives fail, cloud services shut down, accounts get deleted. And what happens to our digital memories when we're gone?

## The Solution

**Lumina** is a decentralized platform that preserves your memories forever on the blockchain, encrypted and sealed until conditions you set are met.

### How It Works

1. **Upload & Encrypt**: Upload photos, videos, or voice recordings. Your memories are encrypted using Lit Protocol's threshold encryption before being stored on Walrus decentralized storage.

2. **Set Conditions**: Choose when your memory unlocks:
   - **Time-Locked**: Unlock on a specific future date
   - **Manual**: Unlock anytime you want
   - **Inheritance**: Automatically unlock for loved ones if you become inactive

3. **Mint as NFT**: Each memory is minted as an NFT on Sui blockchain, giving you permanent, verifiable ownership.

4. **Seal Forever**: Your encrypted memory is sealed on-chain. No one can access it until your conditions are met - not even us.

5. **Unlock When Ready**: When time passes or conditions are met, you can decrypt and access your memories.
